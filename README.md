# FinanceHub

FinanceHub - as I named this application temporarily - is going to be a fully-managed inventory control application developed for a venezuelan company. It's being planned to run on top of AWS EC2. It's being written in Python+Flask and interacts with a Microsoft SQL Server that will run on Amazon RDS. For the moment it's running locally. Feel free to review the code :)
