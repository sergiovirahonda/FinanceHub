# Finance Hub

Finance Hub - as I named this application temporarily - is going to be a fully-managed inventory control application developed for a venezuelan company. It's being planned to run on top of AWS EC2 and written in Python+Flask - interacts with a Microsoft SQL Server database that will run on Amazon RDS but for the moment it's running locally. It contains several modules that manage specific parts of the application and the main.py file is the main module.

Feel free to check the project out :)
